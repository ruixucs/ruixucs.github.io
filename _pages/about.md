Iâ€™m Xuehai Zhou, a first-year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Bioresource Engineering](https://www.mcgill.ca/bioeng/) at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/), where I am fortunate to be guided by [Prof. Shangpeng Sun](https://shangpenglab.github.io/#/). My research is centered on advancing plant phenotyping, exploring the complexities of root system architecture, integrating sensor fusion, and applying AI technologies to enhance agricultural practices.

Before beginning my Ph.D., I earned my M.S. in Bioresource Engineering from McGill University in 2024, also under the mentorship of Prof. Shangpeng Sun. I completed my B.S. in [Computer Science](https://scds.uoregon.edu/cs) at the [University of Oregon](https://www.uoregon.edu/) in 2021.
